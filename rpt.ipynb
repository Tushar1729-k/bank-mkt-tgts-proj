    "You will submit a Jupyter Notebook that walks a reader through your analysis. The notebook should effectively communicate the \"story\" of your data analysis: not just what you found, but how you found it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should start with a brief introduction to the problem (utilize markdown cells for this). What is the data science problem you are trying to solve? Why does the problem matter? What could the results of your predictive model be used for? Why would we want to be able to predict the thing youâ€™re trying to predict? Then describe the dataset that you will use to tackle this problem.\n",

    "Given direct marketing campaign data from a Portuguese banking institution, can we predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit?\n",
    "\n",
    "A term deposit is a fixed-term investment that includes the deposit of money into an account at a financial institution. These investments usually carry short-term maturities ranging from just a month, to a couple years. A client's money is invested for a certain rate of interest over the whole term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Term deposits also happen to be a significant source of income for banks. One way that banks will advertise term deposits is through telephonic marketing, which is considered to be one of the more viable marketing methods. However, telephonic marketing campaigns generate large costs through the hiring of call centers. Therefore, it is financially prudent for banks to figure out which customers are the most likely to convert first, and then proceed with targeting them with telephonic marketing after."
